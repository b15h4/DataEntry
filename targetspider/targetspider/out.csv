Sulfate Free
Highlights
For all hair types
Lightly clarifying
High lathering
Safe for daily use
Sulfate-free
The shampoo for pretty much anyone. The thing I love about this formula is it gets your hair super clean but also leaves it feeling moisturized and looking shiny. It's hard to find a shampoo, particularly a sulfate-free shampoo, that can do both so well.

Lather, rinse, repeat! You know the drill, right!?
How to:
1. Depending on the thickness of your hair, squeeze a dime to quarter-sized amount of shampoo into your palm.
2. Apply to wet hair, massaging into the scalp to create a rich lather.
3. Rinse clean and repeat if necessary.
Tip: If my hair is extra oily or has a lot of product in it, I like to shampoo twice.

Contains Zip-Up Technology™, our proprietary strengthening complex designed to ""zip-up"" split ends while targeting weak areas of the hair, smoothing the appearance of damaged cuticles and helping to protect hair from environmental stressors and color fade.

The One Purple Shampoo
I love brass… in my house, not your hair. I wanted to create a purple shampoo that was both great for toning and also sulfate-free because I've always had a hard time finding that combo. If you like ashier tones, you can use this every time you shampoo. If you want more neutral tones, use it every other time you shampoo to balance out unwanted brassiness. It can be used with or without The One Purple Conditioner. And yes, this shampoo can be used on color treated or naturally blonde hair.
One and done.

Toning time!


How to:
1. Depending on the thickness of your hair, apply a dime to quarter-sized amount of shampoo into your palm.

2. Apply to wet hair, massaging into the scalp to create a rich lather.

3. With purple shampoo you want to make sure you apply more product where you see more brass. I like to let it sit a little longer toward the top where hair is less porous and tends to be warmer in tone (2-3 min), then I let it run down through the ends where it's more porous for less time (1-2 min).

4. Rinse well and follow with conditioner.
Tip: If ever you go overboard and your hair gets too ashy for your liking, just shampoo once with The One Signature Shampoo to remove one level of tone.

PATCH TEST: Apply a small amount of product to dry, cleansed inner side of elbow. Wait for 48 hours. Do not use this product if you experience any burning, redness, swelling or itching.

The One Purple Conditioner
For those who are really prone to unwanted brassiness, take at-home toning one step further with purple conditioner. I created this with moisture and tone in mind. Most people who experience brassiness have had bleach or color applied to their hair so moisture and shine are a top priority. This can be used with or without The One Purple Shampoo.
Let's seal the deal.
How to:

1. After shampooing + rinsing, depending on the thickness of your hair, squeeze a dime to quarter-sized amount into your palm.

2. Apply to wet hair starting at the ends and working your way up to the top, avoiding the last inch or two near the root.

3. Wait 3 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.

Tip: If ever you over-do it and your hair is too ashy for your liking, just shampoo once with The One Signature Shampoo to remove one level of tone.

My favorite thing about this dry shampoo is the amount of powder that deposits onto hair. The hair feels freshly clean when I use this, and if you ever over-do it with a shine product, this can be layered on top to soak up a little bit of the excess.

My favorite, translucent, powder-based dry shampoo is also infused with vitamin C!
How to:
1. Apply to dirty or clean hair at the root. (Do not apply on wet hair!)
2. Gently tap the powder into the hair or brush through to make any visible powder disappear.
Tip: This can be used on clean hair as well to soak up oil as it comes out!

Contains Zip-Up Technology™, our proprietary strengthening complex designed to ""zip-up"" split ends while targeting weak areas of the hair, smoothing the appearance of damaged cuticles and helping to protect hair from environmental stressors and color fade.

Ultra-light hold
Soft matte finish
Hands down, the best affordable dry texturizing spray. I truly mean that. Create a soft matte texture or lived-in look by applying a light veil all over. Focus mostly on the roots and middle of the hair.
Rarely do I make waves without this.
How to:
1. Create your desired hairstyle.
2. Add textured, soft matte finish and lasting hold by spraying this at the root first and then add a small amount from middle to ends.
Tip: Apply a little, wait 30 seconds, then see if you need more. Give the spray a chance to dry, creating texture and grit before adding a second layer.
Contains Zip-Up Technology, our proprietary strengthening complex designed to ""zip-up"" split ends while targeting weak areas of the hair, smoothing the appearance of damaged cuticles and helping to protect hair from environmental stressors and color fade.

Extra Gentle Conditioner
As someone with very sensitive skin and scalp myself, I think it's important to have an option for those of us who need an extra gentle formula and a more subtle fragrance. This sulfate-free conditioner will leave your hair soft, shiny and totally weightless.
Soften and smooth the parts of your hair your natural oils can't reach.
How to:
1. After shampooing + rinsing, depending on the thickness of your hair, squeeze a dime to quarter-sized amount into your palm.
2. On wet hair, apply from the bottom and work your way to the top.
3. Wait 3 minutes and rinse thoroughly.
Tip: Not rinsing conditioner thoroughly can cause build up. Get in there, girl!

Rose Gold Temporary Tint
I'm always looking for ways to play with pastel tones in the hair. This is the first ever in-shower watercolor that creates a temporary tone when sprayed on wet hair and then rinsed out. The intensity is up to you. When you spray it on damp, towel-dried hair it will soak up more color and last longer. If you spray it on wet hair it will give you a more subtle tone and will rinse out faster. The pink tone is most visible on pre-lightened/highlighted or blonde hair and washes out in 1-3 shampoos depending on the porosity of your hair.
Rosé all day weekend!
How to:

1. Shampoo your hair and rinse.

2. Apply spray in the shower on wet hair. For a more intense pink color, towel dry the hair before you spray. For a more subtle hint of pink, spray it directly on freshly rinsed hair. (The less water there is on the hair, the more tone the hair will soak up. Think of your hair as a sponge! If it's full of water it can only absorb a little color.)
3. Once you feel you've covered the hair you want to color, wait 1-2 minutes and then rinse.

4. Follow it up with your favorite conditioner or mask.
Tip: Do a small test piece in the sink and then blow dry it. You'll know how much color your hair will soak up and how quickly it will rinse out.

PATCH TEST: Apply a small amount of product to dry, cleansed inner side of elbow. Wait for 48 hours. Do not use this product if you experience any burning, redness, swelling or itching.

Sea Salt Air Dry Spray
Where do I even start with this one? This is a brand new kind of sea salt spray. First of all, can we talk about the spray? SO OBSESSED! It has a super-fine, constant mist which ensures a more even application than your average pump applicator. Second, the feeling! No salty, crunchy, chalky texture, just satin-grit that stays touchable and soft. Btw, the difference between this one and my Soft Shine Beach Wave Spray is this one goes on wet/damp hair and the other one is for finishing so that one goes on dry hair.
Waves for days!

How to:
1. Apply an even mist all over on damp, towel or t-shirt dried hair.
2. Scrunch your hair as it air dries to encourage any wave pattern.

Tip: I don't recommend using this on tighter curls or any hair type that needs moisture. Try the Soft Shine Beach Wave Spray on curly hair types instead!

Root-to-end volumizing
Instant fullness
Shine renewing
Lasting style support
Imagine a liquid mousse. I use this whenever I need to evenly distribute volume throughout the hair. I spray this on towel-dried, combed out hair and it instantly volumizes without weighing anything down. Leaves the hair looking shiny and full.

An easy-to-apply alternative for those who have trouble using a traditional mousse, but still want to add thickness and lasting hold after styling.
1. Apply to towel dried hair before blow drying.
2. Use 5-7 sprays from roots to ends, making sure you apply as evenly as possible.
3. Flip hair upside down while blow drying for extra lift and hold at the root.
4. Once hair is completely dry, style with hot tools as desired.
Tip: This will provide great support, lasting hold and finish when styling with hot tools, which allows you to avoid using hairspray before curling or flat ironing.

TELL ME EVERYTHING
People always ask me why they would use a curling wand versus a curling iron. The answer is simple, you use a wand then you want fuller, more voluminous waves/curls. And you use a curling iron when you want more polished, textured waves. This wand is my go to for creating loose waves on medium to long lengths, or subtle bend shorter lengths.

SOFT WAVES + VOLUMINOUS CURLS
Perfect for creating easy, everyday waves or soft, bouncy curls

TAKE IT EASY
Innovative handle rotates from 180° to 90°, for easier styling, and less stress on your arms

QUICK + EFFICIENT
Titanium barrel with temperature sensing rapid heat technology out performs ceramic, delivering fast, even heat, for more consistent curls and longer lasing styles

SHINE ON
Negative ions help lock in moisture, enhance shine and eliminate frizz

TO EACH THEIR OWN

Fizzing skin powder cleanses and exfoliates skin
Use as a mask to purify skin
Superfood kale nourishes skin
One pack contains 15+ applications
Vegan, all-natural skincare suits your lifestyle
Keep your skin refreshed and radiant with the unique Skin Fizz Green Kale and Lemongrass Oil Facial Treatment from Nugg. This superfood-powered 3-in-1 fizzing facial combines the benefits of a cleanser, exfoliator and mask all in one product. Just like a bath bomb for your skin! Nutrient-rich Kale nourishes and purifies your skin while Lemongrass Oil cleanses, serves as a natural astringent and lifts your spirits with its pleasant natural spa scent. The all natural and vegan formula is cruelty free and made without alcohol, mineral oil, parabens, preservatives, sulfates, synthetic fragrances, and synthetic colors. One re-sealable pouch contains enough powder for 15+ applications.

Mix about ¼ teaspoon of powder with about ¼ teaspoon of water in the palm of your hand (after breaking down ""crumbs"" into powder if necessary). Mix with your fingertip until powder forms a fizzing foam, adding drops of water as needed. Apply quickly onto face, avoiding eyes and mouth. Gently massage into skin and rinse off. Close pouch carefully, and store leftover powder in a dry space. Use 2-3 times a week. The lemongrass cleanses and exfoliates the skin, while the kale nourishes.

Proudly made in the USA.

Tips and tricks: For a more spa-like experience, pamper yourself by leaving the mixture on your face as a mask for 2-3 minutes. This will really let the ingredients get to work.
